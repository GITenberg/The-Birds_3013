description: The Birds is a comic play by the Greek playwright Aristophanes. It garnered
  awards in 141 BC when it was first performed, and continues to be critically received
  today. A middle-aged Athenian convinces the world's birds to build a new city between
  the heavens and the earth. This position fortuitously allows them to intercept all
  communication of gods and men.
