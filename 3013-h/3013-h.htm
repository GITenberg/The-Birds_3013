    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      'The Birds' differs markedly from all the other Comedies of Aristophanes
      which have come down to us in subject and general conception. It is just
      an extravaganza pure and simple&mdash;a graceful, whimsical theme chosen
      expressly for the sake of the opportunities it afforded of bright, amusing
      dialogue, pleasing lyrical interludes, and charming displays of brilliant
      stage effects and pretty dresses. Unlike other plays of the same Author,
      there is here apparently no serious political MOTIF underlying the surface
      burlesque and buffoonery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some critics, it is true, profess to find in it a reference to the
      unfortunate Sicilian Expedition, then in progress, and a prophecy of its
      failure and the political downfall of Alcibiades. But as a matter of fact,
      the whole thing seems rather an attempt on the dramatist's part to relieve
      the overwrought minds of his fellow-citizens, anxious and discouraged at
      the unsatisfactory reports from before Syracuse, by a work conceived in a
      lighter vein than usual and mainly unconnected with contemporary
      realities. The play was produced in the year 414 B.C., just when success
      or failure in Sicily hung in the balance, though already the outlook was
      gloomy, and many circumstances pointed to impending disaster. Moreover,
      the public conscience was still shocked and perturbed over the mysterious
      affair of the mutilation of the Hermae, which had occurred immediately
      before the sailing of the fleet, and strongly suspicious of Alcibiades'
      participation in the outrage. In spite of the inherent charm of the
      subject, the splendid outbursts of lyrical poetry in some of the choruses
      and the beauty of the scenery and costumes, 'The Birds' failed to win the
      first prize. This was acclaimed to a play of Aristophanes' rival,
      Amipsias, the title of which, 'The Comastoe,' or 'Revellers,' "seems to
      imply that the chief interest was derived from direct allusions to the
      outrage above mentioned and to the individuals suspected to have been
      engaged in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, which militated against its immediate success, viz. the
      absence of direct allusion to contemporary politics&mdash;there are, of
      course, incidental references here and there to topics and personages of
      the day&mdash;the play appeals perhaps more than any other of our Author's
      productions to the modern reader. Sparkling wit, whimsical fancy, poetic
      charm, are of all ages, and can be appreciated as readily by ourselves as
      by an Athenian audience of two thousand years ago, though, of course, much
      is inevitably lost "without the important adjuncts of music, scenery,
      dresses and what we may call 'spectacle' generally, which we know in this
      instance to have been on the most magnificent scale."
    </p>
    <p>
      The plot is this. Euelpides and Pisthetaerus, two old Athenians, disgusted
      with the litigiousness, wrangling and sycophancy of their countrymen,
      resolve upon quitting Attica. Having heard of the fame of Epops (the
      hoopoe), sometime called Tereus, and now King of the Birds, they
      determine, under the direction of a raven and a jackdaw, to seek from him
      and his subject birds a city free from all care and strife. Arrived at the
      Palace of Epops, they knock, and Trochilus (the wren), in a state of great
      flutter, as he mistakes them for fowlers, opens the door and informs them
      that his Majesty is asleep. When he awakes, the strangers appear before
      him, and after listening to a long and eloquent harangue on the superior
      attractions of a residence among the birds, they propose a notable scheme
      of their own to further enhance its advantages and definitely secure the
      sovereignty of the universe now exercised by the gods of Olympus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The birds are summoned to meet in general council. They come flying up
      from all quarters of the heavens, and after a brief mis-understanding,
      during which they come near tearing the two human envoys to pieces, they
      listen to the exposition of the latters' plan. This is nothing less than
      the building of a new city, to be called Nephelococcygia, or
      'Cloud-cuckoo-town,' between earth and heaven, to be garrisoned and
      guarded by the birds in such a way as to intercept all communication of
      the gods with their worshippers on earth. All steam of sacrifice will be
      prevented from rising to Olympus, and the Immortals will very soon be
      starved into an acceptance of any terms proposed. The new Utopia is duly
      constructed, and the daring plan to secure the sovereignty is in a fair
      way to succeed. Meantime various quacks and charlatans, each with a
      special scheme for improving things, arrive from earth, and are one after
      the other exposed and dismissed. Presently arrives Prometheus, who informs
      Epops of the desperate straits to which the gods are by this time reduced,
      and advises him to push his claims and demand the hand of Basileia
      (Dominion), the handmaid of Zeus. Next an embassy from the Olympians
      appears on the scene, consisting of Heracles, Posidon and a god from the
      savage regions of the Triballians. After some disputation, it is agreed
      that all reasonable demands of the birds are to be granted, while
      Pisthetaerus is to have Basileia as his bride. The comedy winds up with
      the epithalamium in honour of the nuptials.

        SCENE: A wild, desolate tract of open country; broken rocks and
        brushwood occupy the centre of the stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES (TO HIS JAY)(1) Do you think I should walk straight for yon
        tree?
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Euelpides is holding a jay and Pisthetaerus a crow; they are the
        guides who are to lead them to the kingdom of the birds.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS (TO HIS CROW) Cursed beast, what are you croaking to me?...
        to retrace my steps?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Why, you wretch, we are wandering at random, we are exerting
        ourselves only to return to the same spot; 'tis labour lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS To think that I should trust to this crow, which has made
        me cover more than a thousand furlongs!
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES And that I to this jay, which has torn every nail from my
        fingers!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS If only I knew where we were....
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Could you find your country again from here?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS No, I feel quite sure I could not, any more than could
        Execestides(1) find his.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A stranger who wanted to pass as an Athenian, although coming
        originally for a far-away barbarian country.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Oh dear! oh dear!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Aye, aye, my friend, 'tis indeed the road of "oh dears" we
        are following.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES That Philocrates, the bird-seller, played us a scurvy trick,
        when he pretended these two guides could help us to find Tereus,(1) the
        Epops, who is a bird, without being born of one. He has indeed sold us
        this jay, a true son of Tharelides,(2) for an obolus, and this crow for
        three, but what can they do? Why, nothing whatever but bite and scratch!&mdash;What's
        the matter with you then, that you keep opening your beak? Do you want
        us to fling ourselves headlong down these rocks? There is no road that
        way.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A king of Thrace, a son of Ares, who married Procne, the daughter
        of Pandion, King of Athens, whom he had assisted against the Megarians.
        He violated his sister-in-law, Philomela, and then cut out her tongue;
        she nevertheless managed to convey to her sister how she had been
        treated. They both agreed to kill Itys, whom Procne had borne to Tereus,
        and dished up the limbs of his own son to the father; at the end of the
        meal Philomela appeared and threw the child's head upon the table.
        Tereus rushed with drawn sword upon the princesses, but all the actors
        in this terrible scene were metamorph(o)sed. Tereus became an Epops
        (hoopoe), Procne a swallow, Philomela a nightingale, and Itys a
        goldfinch. According to Anacreon and Apollodorus it was Procne who
        became the nightingale and Philomela the swallow, and this is the
        version of the tradition followed by Aristophanes.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) An Athenian who had some resemblance to a jay&mdash;so says the
        scholiast, at any rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Not even the vestige of a track in any direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES And what does the crow say about the road to follow?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS By Zeus, it no longer croaks the same thing it did.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES And which way does it tell us to go now?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS It says that, by dint of gnawing, it will devour my
        fingers.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES What misfortune is ours! we strain every nerve to get to the
        birds,(1) do everything we can to that end, and we cannot find our way!
        Yes, spectators, our madness is quite different from that of Sacas. He
        is not a citizen, and would fain be one at any cost; we, on the
        contrary, born of an honourable tribe and family and living in the midst
        of our fellow-citizens, we have fled from our country as hard as ever we
        could go. 'Tis not that we hate it; we recognize it to be great and
        rich, likewise that everyone has the right to ruin himself; but the
        crickets only chirrup among the fig-trees for a month or two, whereas
        the Athenians spend their whole lives in chanting forth judgments from
        their law-courts.(2) That is why we started off with a basket, a
        stew-pot and some myrtle boughs(3) and have come to seek a quiet country
        in which to settle. We are going to Tereus, the Epops, to learn from
        him, whether, in his aerial flights, he has noticed some town of this
        kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Literally, 'to go to the crows,' a proverbial expression equivalent
        to our 'going to the devil.'
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) They leave Athens because of their hatred of lawsuits and
        informers; this is the especial failing of the Athenians satirized in
        'The Wasps.'
      </p>
      <p>
        f(3) Myrtle boughs were used in sacrifices, and the founding of every
        colony was started by a sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Here! look!
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES What's the matter?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Why, the crow has been pointing me to something up there
        for some time now.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES And the jay is also opening its beak and craning its neck to
        show me I know not what. Clearly, there are some birds about here. We
        shall soon know, if we kick up a noise to start them.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Do you know what to do? Knock your leg against this rock.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES And you your head to double the noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Well then use a stone instead; take one and hammer with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Good idea! Ho there, within! Slave! slave!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What's that, friend! You say, "slave," to summon Epops! It
        would be much better to shout, "Epops, Epops!"
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Well then, Epops! Must I knock again? Epops!
      </p>
      <p>
        TROCHILUS Who's there? Who calls my master?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Apollo the Deliverer! what an enormous beak!(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The actors wore masks made to resemble the birds they were supposed
        to represent.
      </p>
      <p>
        TROCHILUS Good god! they are bird-catchers.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES The mere sight of him petrifies me with terror. What a
        horrible monster.
      </p>
      <p>
        TROCHILUS Woe to you!
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES But we are not men.
      </p>
      <p>
        TROCHILUS What are you, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES I am the Fearling, an African bird.
      </p>
      <p>
        TROCHILUS You talk nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Well, then, just ask it of my feet.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Fear had had disastrous effects upon Euelpides' internal economy,
        and this his feet evidenced.
      </p>
      <p>
        TROCHILUS And this other one, what bird is it?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS I? I am a Cackling,(1) from the land of the pheasants.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The same mishap had occurred to Pisthetaerus.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES But you yourself, in the name of the gods! what animal are
        you?
      </p>
      <p>
        TROCHILUS Why, I am a slave-bird.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Why, have you been conquered by a cock?
      </p>
      <p>
        TROCHILUS No, but when my master was turned into a peewit, he begged me
        to become a bird too, to follow and to serve him.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Does a bird need a servant, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        TROCHILUS 'Tis no doubt because he was a man. At times he wants to eat a
        dish of loach from Phalerum; I seize my dish and fly to fetch him some.
        Again he wants some pea-soup; I seize a ladle and a pot and run to get
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES This is, then, truly a running-bird.(1) Come, Trochilus, do us
        the kindness to call your master.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The Greek word for a wren is derived from the same root as 'to
        run.'
      </p>
      <p>
        TROCHILUS Why, he has just fallen asleep after a feed of myrtle-berries
        and a few grubs.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Never mind; wake him up.
      </p>
      <p>
        TROCHILUS I an certain he will be angry. However, I will wake him to
        please you.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS You cursed brute! why, I am almost dead with terror!
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Oh! my god! 'twas sheer fear that made me lose my jay.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ah! you great coward! were you so frightened that you let
        go your jay?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES And did you not lose your crow, when you fell sprawling on the
        ground? Pray tell me that.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS No, no.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Where is it, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS It has flown away.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Then you did not let it go? Oh! you brave fellow!
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Open the forest,(1) that I may go out!
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) No doubt there was some scenery to represent a forest. Besides,
        there is a pun intended. The words answering for 'forests' and 'door' in
        Greek only differ slightly in sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES By Heracles! what a creature! what plumage! What means this
        triple crest?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Who wants me?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES The twelve great gods have used you ill, meseems.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Are you chaffing me about my feathers? I have been a man,
        strangers.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES 'Tis not you we are jeering at.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS At what, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Why, 'tis your beak that looks so odd to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS This is how Sophocles outrages me in his tragedies. Know, I once
        was Tereus.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Sophocles had written a tragedy about Tereus, in which, no doubt,
        the king finally appears as a hoopoe.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES You were Tereus, and what are you now? a bird or a peacock?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) (O)ne would expect the question to be "bird or man."&mdash;Are you
        a peacock? The hoopoe resembles the peacock inasmuch as both have
        crests.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS I am a bird.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Then where are your feathers? For I don't see them.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS They have fallen off.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Through illness?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS No. All birds moult their feathers, you know, every winter, and
        others grow in their place. But tell me, who are you?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES We? We are mortals.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS From what country?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES From the land of the beautiful galleys.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Athens.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Are you dicasts?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The Athenians were madly addicted to lawsuits. (See 'The Wasps.')
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES No, if anything, we are anti-dicasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Is that kind of seed sown among you?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) As much as to say, 'Then you have such things as anti-dicasts?' And
        Euelpides practically replaces, 'Very few.'
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES You have to look hard to find even a little in our fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS What brings you here?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES We wish to pay you a visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS What for?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Because you formerly were a man, like we are, formerly you had
        debts, as we have, formerly you did not want to pay them, like
        ourselves; furthermore, being turned into a bird, you have when flying
        seen all lands and seas. Thus you have all human knowledge as well as
        that of birds. And hence we have come to you to beg you to direct us to
        some cosy town, in which one can repose as if on thick coverlets.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS And are you looking for a greater city than Athens?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES No, not a greater, but one more pleasant to dwell in.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Then you are looking for an aristocratic country.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES I? Not at all! I hold the son of Scellias in horror.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) His name was Aristocrates; he was a general and commanded a fleet
        sent in aid of Corcyra.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS But, after all, what sort of city would please you best?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES A place where the following would be the most important
        business transacted.&mdash;Some friend would come knocking at the door
        quite early in the morning saying, "By Olympian Zeus, be at my house
        early, as soon as you have bathed, and bring your children too. I am
        giving a nuptial feast, so don't fail, or else don't cross my threshold
        when I am in distress."
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Ah! that's what may be called being fond of hardships! And what
        say you?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS My tastes are similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS And they are?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS I want a town where the father of a handsome lad will stop
        in the street and say to me reproachfully as if I had failed him, "Ah!
        Is this well done, Stilbonides! You met my son coming from the bath
        after the gymnasium and you neither spoke to him, nor embraced him, nor
        took him with you, nor ever once twitched his parts. Would anyone call
        you an old friend of mine?"
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Ah! wag, I see you are fond of suffering. But there is a city of
        delights, such as you want. 'Tis on the Red Sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Oh, no. Not a sea-port, where some fine morning the
        Salaminian(1) galley can appear, bringing a writ-server along. Have you
        no Greek town you can propose to us?
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The State galley, which carried the officials of the Athenian
        republic to their several departments and brought back those whose time
        had expired; it was this galley that was sent to Sicily to fetch back
        Alcibiades, who was accused of sacrilege.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Why not choose Lepreum in Elis for your settlement?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES By Zeus! I could not look at Lepreum without disgust, because
        of Melanthius.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A tragic poet, who was a leper; there is a play, of course, on the
        word Lepreum.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Then, again, there is the Opuntian, where you could live.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES I would not be Opuntian(1) for a talent. But come, what is it
        like to live with the birds? You should know pretty well.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) An allusion to Opuntius, who was one-eyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Why, 'tis not a disagreeable life. In the first place, one has no
        purse.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES That does away with much roguery.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS For food the gardens yield us white sesame, myrtle-berries,
        poppies and mint.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Why, 'tis the life of the newly-wed indeed.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The newly-married ate a sesame-cake, decorated with garlands of
        myrtle, poppies and mint.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ha! I am beginning to see a great plan, which will transfer
        the supreme power to the birds, if you will but take my advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Take your advice? In what way?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS In what way? Well, firstly, do not fly in all directions
        with open beak; it is not dignified. Among us, when we see a thoughtless
        man, we ask, "What sort of bird is this?" and Teleas answers, "'Tis a
        man who has no brain, a bird that has lost his head, a creature you
        cannot catch, for it never remains in any one place."
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS By Zeus himself! your jest hits the mark. What then is to be done?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Found a city.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS We birds? But what sort of city should we build?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Oh, really, really! 'tis spoken like a fool! Look down.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS I am looking.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Now look upwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS I am looking.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Turn your head round.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Ah! 'twill be pleasant for me, if I end in twisting my neck!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What have you seen?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS The clouds and the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Very well! is not this the pole of the birds then?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS How their pole?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Or, if you like it, the land. And since it turns and passes
        through the whole universe, it is called, 'pole.'(1) If you build and
        fortify it, you will turn your pole into a fortified city.(2) In this
        way you will reign over mankind as you do over the grasshoppers and
        cause the gods to die of rabid hunger.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) From (the word meaning) 'to turn.'
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) The Greek words for 'pole' and 'city' only differ by a single
        letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS How so?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS The air is 'twixt earth and heaven. When we want to go to
        Delphi, we ask the Boeotians(1) for leave of passage; in the same way,
        when men sacrifice to the gods, unless the latter pay you tribute, you
        exercise the right of every nation towards strangers and don't allow the
        smoke of the sacrifices to pass through your city and territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Boeotia separated Attica from Phocis.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS By earth! by snares! by network!(1) I never heard of anything more
        cleverly conceived; and, if the other birds approve, I am going to build
        the city along with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) He swears by the powers that are to him dreadful.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Who will explain the matter to them?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS You must yourself. Before I came they were quite ignorant, but
        since I have lived with them I have taught them to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS But how can they be gathered together?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Easily. I will hasten down to the coppice to waken my dear
        Procne!(1) as soon as they hear our voices, they will come to us hot
        wing.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) As already stated, according to the legend accepted by
        Aristophanes, it was Procne who was turned into the nightengale.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS My dear bird, lose no time, I beg. Fly at once into the
        coppice and awaken Procne.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Chase off drowsy sleep, dear companion. Let the sacred hymn gush
        from thy divine throat in melodious strains; roll forth in soft cadence
        your refreshing melodies to bewail the fate of Itys,(1) which has been
        the cause of so many tears to us both. Your pure notes rise through the
        thick leaves of the yew-tree right up to the throne of Zeus, where
        Phoebus listens to you, Phoebus with his golden hair. And his ivory lyre
        responds to your plaintive accents; he gathers the choir of the gods and
        from their immortal lips rushes a sacred chant of blessed voices. (THE
        FLUTE IS PLAYED BEHIND THE SCENE.)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The son of Tereus and Procne.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Oh! by Zeus! what a throat that little bird possesses. He
        has filled the whole coppice with honey-sweet melody!
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Hush!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What's the matter?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Will you keep silence?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What for?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Epops is going to sing again.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS (IN THE COPPICE) Epopoi poi popoi, epopoi, popoi, here, here,
        quick, quick, quick, my comrades in the air; all you who pillage the
        fertile lands of the husbandmen, the numberless tribes who gather and
        devour the barley seeds, the swift flying race who sing so sweetly. And
        you whose gentle twitter resounds through the fields with the little cry
        of tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio; and you who hop about the
        branches of the ivy in the gardens; the mountain birds, who feed on the
        wild olive berries or the arbutus, hurry to come at my call, trioto,
        trioto, totobrix; you also, who snap up the sharp-stinging gnats in the
        marshy vales, and you who dwell in the fine plain of Marathon, all damp
        with dew, and you, the francolin with speckled wings; you too, the
        halcyons, who flit over the swelling waves of the sea, come hither to
        hear the tidings; let all the tribes of long-necked birds assemble here;
        know that a clever old man has come to us, bringing an entirely new idea
        and proposing great reforms. Let all come to the debate here, here,
        here, here. Torotorotorotorotix, kikkobau, kikkobau,
        torotorotorotorolililix.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Can you see any bird?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES By Phoebus, no! and yet I am straining my eyesight to scan the
        sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Twas really not worth Epops' while to go and bury himself
        in the thicket like a plover when a-hatching.
      </p>
      <p>
        PHOENICOPTERUS Torotina, torotina.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Hold, friend, here is another bird.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES I' faith, yes, 'tis a bird, but of what kind? Isn't it a
        peacock?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Epops will tell us. What is this bird?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS 'Tis not one of those you are used to seeing; 'tis a bird from the
        marshes.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Oh! oh! but he is very handsome with his wings as crimson
        as flame.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Undoubtedly; indeed he is called flamingo.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) An African bird, that comes to the southern countries of Europe, to
        Greece, Italy, and Spain; it is even seen in Provence.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Hi! I say! You!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What are you shouting for?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Why, here's another bird.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Aye, indeed; 'tis a foreign bird too. What is this bird
        from beyond the mountains with a look as solemn as it is stupid?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS He is called the Mede.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Aristophanes amusingly mixes up real birds with people and
        individuals, whom he represents in the form of birds; he is personifying
        the Medians here.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS The Mede! But, by Heracles, how, if a Mede, has he flown
        here without a camel?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Here's another bird with a crest.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ah! that's curious. I say, Epops, you are not the only one
        of your kind then?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS This bird is the son of Philocles, who is the son of Epops;(1) so
        that, you see, I am his grandfather; just as one might say,
        Hipponicus,(2) the son of Callias, who is the son of Hipponicus.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Philocles, a tragic poet, had written a tragedy on Tereus, which
        was simply a plagiarism of the play of the same name by Sophocles.
        Philocles is the son of Epops, because he got his inspiration from
        Sophocles' Tereus, and at the same time is father to Epops, since he
        himself produced another Tereus.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) This Hipponicus is probably the orator whose ears Alcibiades boxed
        to gain a bet; he was a descendant of Callias, who was famous for his
        hatred of Pisistratus.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Then this bird is Callias! Why, what a lot of his feathers
        he has lost!(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) This Callias, who must not be confounded with the foe of
        Pisistratus, had ruined himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS That's because he is honest; so the informers set upon him and the
        women too pluck out his feathers.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS By Posidon, do you see that many-coloured bird? What is his
        name?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS This one? 'Tis the glutton.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Is there another glutton besides Cleonymus? But why, if he
        is Cleonymus, has he not thrown away his crest?(1) But what is the
        meaning of all these crests? Have these birds come to contend for the
        double stadium prize?(2)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Cleonymus had cast away his shield; he was as great a glutton as he
        was a coward.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) A race in which the track had to be circled twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS They are like the Carians, who cling to the crests of their
        mountains for greater safety.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A people of Asia Minor; when pursued by the Ionians they took
        refuge in the mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Oh, Posidon! do you see what swarms of birds are gathering
        here?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES By Phoebus! what a cloud! The entrance to the stage is no
        longer visible, so closely do they fly together.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Here is the partridge.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Faith! there is the francolin.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS There is the poachard.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Here is the kingfisher. And over yonder?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS 'Tis the barber.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES What? a bird a barber?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Why, Sporgilus is one.(1) Here comes the owl.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) An Athenian barber.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES And who is it brings an owl to Athens?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The owl was dedicated to Athene, and being respected at Athens, it
        had greatly multiplied. Hence the proverb, 'taking owls to Athens,'
        similar to our English 'taking coals to Newcastle.'
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Here is the magpie, the turtle-dove, the swallow, the
        horned owl, the buzzard, the pigeon, the falcon, the ring-dove, the
        cuckoo, the red-foot, the red-cap, the purple-cap, the kestrel, the
        diver, the ousel, the osprey, the woodpecker.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Oh! oh! what a lot of birds! what a quantity of blackbirds!
        how they scold, how they come rushing up! What a noise! what a noise!
        Can they be bearing us ill-will? Oh! there! there! they are opening
        their beaks and staring at us.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Why, so they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Popopopopopopopoi. Where is he who called me? Where am I to find
        him?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS I have been waiting for you this long while! I never fail in my
        word to my friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Titititititititi. What good thing have you to tell me?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Something that concerns our common safety, and that is just as
        pleasant as it is to the purpose. Two men, who are subtle reasoners,
        have come here to seek me.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Where? What? What are you saying?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS I say, two old men have come from the abode of men to propose a
        vast and splendid scheme to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Oh! 'tis a horrible, unheard-of crime! What are you saying?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Nay! never let my words scare you.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS What have you done then?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS I have welcomed two men, who wish to live with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS And you have dared to do that!
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Aye, and am delighted at having done so.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Where are they?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS In your midst, as I am.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Ah! ah! we are betrayed; 'tis sacrilege! Our friend, he who
        picked up corn-seeds in the same plains as ourselves, has violated our
        ancient laws; he has broken the oaths that bind all birds; he has laid a
        snare for me, he has handed us over to the attacks of that impious race
        which, throughout all time, has never ceased to war against us. As for
        this traitorous bird, we will decide his case later, but the two old men
        shall be punished forthwith; we are going to tear them to pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis all over with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES You are the sole cause of all our trouble. Why did you bring
        me from down yonder?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS To have you with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Say rather to have me melt into tears.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Go to! you are talking nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES How so?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS How will you be able to cry when once your eyes are pecked
        out?
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Io! io! forward to the attack, throw yourselves upon the foe,
        spill his blood; take to your wings and surround them on all sides. Woe
        to them! let us get to work with our beaks, let us devour them. Nothing
        can save them from our wrath, neither the mountain forests, nor the
        clouds that float in the sky, nor the foaming deep. Come, peck, tear to
        ribbons. Where is the chief of the cohort? Let him engage the right
        wing.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES This is the fatal moment. Where shall I fly to, unfortunate
        wretch that I am?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Stay! stop here!
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES That they may tear me to pieces?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS And how do you think to escape them?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES I don't know at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Come, I will tell you. We must stop and fight them. Let us
        arm ourselves with these stew-pots.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Why with the stew-pots?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS The owl will not attack us.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) An allusion to the Feast of Pots; it was kept at Athens on the
        third day of the Anthesteria, when all sorts of vegetables were stewed
        together and offered for the dead to Bacchus and Athene. This Feast was
        peculiar to Athens.&mdash;Hence Pisthetaerus thinks that the owl will
        recognize they are Athenians by seeing the stew-pots, and as he is an
        Athenian bird, he will not attack them.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES But do you see all those hooked claws?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Seize the spit and pierce the foe on your side.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES And how about my eyes?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Protect them with this dish or this vinegar-pot.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Oh! what cleverness! what inventive genius! You are a great
        general, even greater than Nicias,(1) where stratagem is concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Nicias, the famous Athenian general.&mdash;The siege of Melos in
        417 B.C., or two years previous to the production of 'The Birds,' had
        especially done him great credit. He was joint commander of the Sicilian
        expedition.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Forward, forward, charge with your beaks! Come, no delay. Tear,
        pluck, strike, flay them, and first of all smash the stew-pot.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Oh, most cruel of all animals, why tear these two men to pieces,
        why kill them? What have they done to you? They belong to the same
        tribe, to the same family as my wife.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Procne, the daughter of Pandion, King of Athens.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Are wolves to be spared? Are they not our most mortal foes? So
        let us punish them.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS If they are your foes by nature, they are your friends in heart,
        and they come here to give you useful advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Advice or a useful word from their lips, from them, the enemies
        of my forebears!
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS The wise can often profit by the lessons of a foe, for caution is
        the mother of safety. 'Tis just such a thing as one will not learn from
        a friend and which an enemy compels you to know. To begin with, 'tis the
        foe and not the friend that taught cities to build high walls, to equip
        long vessels of war; and 'tis this knowledge that protects our children,
        our slaves and our wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Well then, I agree, let us first hear them, for 'tis best; one
        can even learn something in an enemy's school.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Their wrath seems to cool. Draw back a little.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS 'Tis only justice, and you will thank me later.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Never have we opposed your advice up to now.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS They are in a more peaceful mood; put down your stew-pot
        and your two dishes; spit in hand, doing duty for a spear, let us mount
        guard inside the camp close to the pot and watch in our arsenal closely;
        for we must not fly.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES You are right. But where shall we be buried, if we die?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS In the Ceramicus;(1) for, to get a public funeral, we shall
        tell the Strategi that we fell at Orneae,(2) fighting the country's
        foes.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A space beyond the walls of Athens which contained the gardens of
        the Academy and the graves of citizens who had died for their country.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) A town in Western Argolis, where the Athenians had been recently
        defeated. The somewhat similar work in Greek signifies 'birds.'
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Return to your ranks and lay down your courage beside your wrath
        as the Hoplites do. Then let us ask these men who they are, whence they
        come, and with what intent. Here, Epops, answer me.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Are you calling me? What do you want of me?
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Who are they? From what country?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Strangers, who have come from Greece, the land of the wise.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS And what fate has led them hither to the land of the birds?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Their love for you and their wish to share your kind of life; to
        dwell and remain with you always.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Indeed, and what are their plans?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS They are wonderful, incredible, unheard of.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Why, do they think to see some advantage that determines them to
        settle here? Are they hoping with our help to triumph over their foes or
        to be useful to their friends?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS They speak of benefits so great it is impossible either to
        describe or conceive them; all shall be yours, all that we see here,
        there, above and below us; this they vouch for.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Are they mad?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS They are the sanest people in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Clever men?
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS The slyest of foxes, cleverness its very self, men of the world,
        cunning, the cream of knowing folk.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Tell them to speak and speak quickly; why, as I listen to you, I
        am beside myself with delight.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Here, you there, take all these weapons and hang them up inside
        close to the fire, near the figure of the god who presides there and
        under his protection;(1) as for you, address the birds, tell them why I
        have gathered them together.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Epops is addressing the two slaves, no doubt Xanthias and Manes,
        who are mentioned later on.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Not I, by Apollo, unless they agree with me as the little
        ape of an armourer agreed with his wife, not to bite me, nor pull me by
        the parts, nor shove things up my...
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS You mean the...(PUTS FINGER TO BOTTOM) Oh! be quite at ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS No, I mean my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Swear it.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS I swear it and, if I keep my promise, let judges and spectators
        give me the victory unanimously.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS It is a bargain.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS And if I break my word, may I succeed by one vote only.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERALD Hearken, ye people! Hoplites, pick up your weapons and return to
        your firesides; do not fail to read the decrees of dismissal we have
        posted.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Man is a truly cunning creature, but nevertheless explain.
        Perhaps you are going to show me some good way to extend my power, some
        way that I have not had the wit to find out and which you have
        discovered. Speak! 'tis to your own interest as well as to mine, for if
        you secure me some advantage, I will surely share it with you. But what
        object can have induced you to come among us? Speak boldly, for I shall
        not break the truce,&mdash;until you have told us all.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS I am bursting with desire to speak; I have already mixed
        the dough of my address and nothing prevents me from kneading it....
        Slave! bring the chaplet and water, which you must pour over my hands.
        Be quick!(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) It was customary, when speaking in public and also at feasts, to
        wear a chaplet; hence the question Euelpides puts.&mdash;The guests wore
        chaplets of flowers, herbs, and leaves, which had the property of being
        refreshing.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Is it a question of feasting? What does it all mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS By Zeus, no! but I am hunting for fine, tasty words to
        break down the hardness of their hearts.&mdash;I grieve so much for you,
        who at one time were kings...
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS We kings! Over whom?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS ...of all that exists, firstly of me and of this man, even
        of Zeus himself. Your race is older than Saturn, the Titans and the
        Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS What, older than the Earth!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS By Phoebus, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS By Zeus, but I never knew that before!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis because you are ignorant and heedless, and have never
        read your Aesop. 'Tis he who tells us that the lark was born before all
        other creatures, indeed before the Earth; his father died of sickness,
        but the Earth did not exist then; he remained unburied for five days,
        when the bird in its dilemma decided, for want of a better place, to
        entomb its father in its own head.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES So that the lark's father is buried at Cephalae.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A deme of Attica. In Greek the word also means 'heads,' and hence
        the pun.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Hence, if we existed before the Earth, before the gods, the
        kingship belongs to us by right of priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Undoubtedly, but sharpen your beak well; Zeus won't be in a
        hurry to hand over his sceptre to the woodpecker.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS It was not the gods, but the birds, who were formerly the
        masters and kings over men; of this I have a thousand proofs. First of
        all, I will point you to the cock, who governed the Persians before all
        other monarchs, before Darius and Megabyzus.(1) 'Tis in memory of his
        reign that he is called the Persian bird.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) One of Darius' best generals. After his expedition against the
        Scythians, this prince gave him the command of the army which he left in
        Europe. Megabyzus took Perinthos (afterwards called Heraclea) and
        conquered Thrace.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES For this reason also, even to-day, he alone of all the birds
        wears his tiara straight on his head, like the Great King.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) All Persians wore the tiara, but always on one side; the Great King
        alone wore it straight on his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS He was so strong, so great, so feared, that even now, on
        account of his ancient power, everyone jumps out of bed as soon as ever
        he crows at daybreak. Blacksmiths, potters, tanners, shoemakers,
        bathmen, corn-dealers, lyre-makers and armourers, all put on their shoes
        and go to work before it is daylight.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES I can tell you something about that. 'Twas the cock's fault
        that I lost a splendid tunic of Phrygian wool. I was at a feast in town,
        given to celebrate the birth of a child; I had drunk pretty freely and
        had just fallen asleep, when a cock, I suppose in a greater hurry than
        the rest, began to crow. I thought it was dawn and set out for
        Alimos.(1) I had hardly got beyond the walls, when a footpad struck me
        in the back with his bludgeon; down I went and wanted to shout, but he
        had already made off with my mantle.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Noted as the birthplace of Thucydides, a deme of Attica of the
        tribe of Leontis. Demosthenes tells us it was thirty-five stadia from
        Athens.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Formerly also the kite was ruler and king over the Greeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS The Greeks?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS And when he was king, 'twas he who first taught them to
        fall on their knees before the kites.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The appearance of the kite in Greece betokened the return of
        springtime; it was therefore worshipped as a symbol of that season.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES By Zeus! 'tis what I did myself one day on seeing a kite; but
        at the moment I was on my knees, and leaning backwards(1) with mouth
        agape, I bolted an obolus and was forced to carry my bag home empty.(2)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) To look at the kite, who no doubt was flying high in the sky.
      </p>

        f(2) As already shown, the Athenians were addicted to carrying small
        coins in their mouths.&mdash;This obolus was for the purpose of buying
        flour to fill the bag he was carrying
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS The cuckoo was king of Egypt and of the whole of Phoenicia.
        When he called out "cuckoo," all the Phoenicians hurried to the fields
        to reap their wheat and their barley.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) In Phoenicia and Egypt the cuckoo makes its appearance about
        harvest-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Hence no doubt the proverb, "Cuckoo! cuckoo! go to the fields,
        ye circumcised."(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) This was an Egyptian proverb, meaning, 'When the cuckoo sings we go
        harvesting.' Both the Phoenicians and the Egyptians practised
        circumcision.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS So powerful were the birds that the kings of Grecian
        cities, Agamemnon, Menelaus, for instance, carried a bird on the tip of
        their sceptres, who had his share of all presents.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The staff, called a sceptre, generally terminated in a piece of
        carved work, representing a flower, a fruit, and most often a bird.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES That I didn't know and was much astonished when I saw Priam
        come upon the stage in the tragedies with a bird, which kept watching
        Lysicrates(1) to see if he got any present.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A general accused of treachery. The bird watches Lysicrates,
        because, according to Pisthetaerus, he had a right to a share of the
        presents.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS But the strongest proof of all is, that Zeus, who now
        reigns, is represented as standing with an eagle on his head as a symbol
        of his royalty;(1) his daughter has an owl, and Phoebus, as his servant,
        has a hawk.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) It is thus that Phidias represents his Olympian Zeus.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES By Demeter, 'tis well spoken. But what are all these birds
        doing in heaven?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS When anyone sacrifices and, according to the rite, offers
        the entrails to the gods, these birds take their share before Zeus.
        Formerly men always swore by the birds and never by the gods; even now
        Lampon(1) swears by the goose, when he wants to lie....Thus 'tis clear
        that you were great and sacred, but now you are looked upon as slaves,
        as fools, as Helots; stones are thrown at you as at raving madmen, even
        in holy places. A crowd of bird-catchers sets snares, traps, limed-twigs
        and nets of all sorts for you; you are caught, you are sold in heaps and
        the buyers finger you over to be certain you are fat. Again, if they
        would but serve you up simply roasted; but they rasp cheese into a
        mixture of oil, vinegar and laserwort, to which another sweet and greasy
        sauce is added, and the whole is poured scalding hot over your back, for
        all the world as if you were diseased meat.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) One of the diviners sent to Sybaris (in Magna Graecia, S. Italy)
        with the Athenian colonists, who rebuilt the town under the new name of
        Thurium.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Man, your words have made my heart bleed; I have groaned over the
        treachery of our fathers, who knew not how to transmit to us the high
        rank they held from their forefathers. But 'tis a benevolent Genius, a
        happy Fate, that sends you to us; you shall be our deliverer and I place
        the destiny of my little ones and my own in your hands with every
        confidence. But hasten to tell me what must be done; we should not be
        worthy to live, if we did not seek to regain our royalty by every
        possible means.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS First I advise that the birds gather together in one city
        and that they build a wall of great bricks, like that at Babylon, round
        the plains of the air and the whole region of space that divides earth
        from heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Oh, Cebriones! oh, Porphyrion!(1) what a terribly strong place!
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) As if he were saying, "Oh, gods!" Like Lampon, he swears by the
        birds, instead of swearing by the gods.&mdash;The names of these birds
        are those of two of the Titans.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Th(en), this being well done and completed, you demand back
        the empire from Zeus; if he will not agree, if he refuses and does not
        at once confess himself beaten, you declare a sacred war against him and
        forbid the gods henceforward to pass through your country with lust, as
        hitherto, for the purpose of fondling their Alcmenas, their Alopes, or
        their Semeles!(1) if they try to pass through, you infibulate them with
        rings so that they can work no longer. You send another messenger to
        mankind, who will proclaim to them that the birds are kings, that for
        the future they must first of all sacrifice to them, and only afterwards
        to the gods; that it is fitting to appoint to each deity the bird that
        has most in common with it. For instance, are they sacrificing to
        Aphrodite, let them at the same time offer barley to the coot; are they
        immolating a sheep to Posidon, let them consecrate wheat in honour of
        the duck;(2) is a steer being offered to Heracles, let honey-cakes be
        dedicated to the gull;(3) is a goat being slain for King Zeus, there is
        a King-Bird, the wren,(4) to whom the sacrifice of a male gnat is due
        before Zeus himself even.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Alcmena, wife of Amphitryon, King of Thebes and mother of Heracles.&mdash;Semele,
        the daughter of Cadmus and Hermione and mother of Bacchus; both seduced
        by Zeus.&mdash;Alope, daughter of Cercyon, a robber, who reigned at
        Eleusis and was conquered by Perseus. Alope was honoured with Posidon's
        caresses; by him she had a son named Hippothous, at first brought up by
        shepherds but who afterwards was restored to the throne of his
        grandfather by Theseus.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) Because water is the duck's domain, as it is that of Posidon.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(3) Because the gull, like Heracles, is voracious.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(4) The Germans still call it 'Zaunkonig' and the French 'roitelet,'
        both names thus containing the idea of 'king.'
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES This notion of an immolated gnat delights me! And now let the
        great Zeus thunder!
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS But how will mankind recognize us as gods and not as jays? Us, who
        have wings and fly?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS You talk rubbish! Hermes is a god and has wings and flies,
        and so do many other gods. First of all, Victory flies with golden
        wings, Eros is undoubtedly winged too, and Iris is compared by Homer to
        a timorous dove.(1) If men in their blindness do not recognize you as
        gods and continue to worship the dwellers in Olympus, then a cloud of
        sparrows greedy for corn must descend upon their fields and eat up all
        their seeds; we shall see then if Demeter will mete them out any wheat.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The scholiast draws our attention to the fact that Homer says this
        of Here and not of Iris (Iliad, V, 778); it is only another proof that
        the text of Homer has reached us in a corrupted form, or it may be that
        Aristophanes was liable, like other people, to occasional mistakes of
        quotation.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES By Zeus, she'll take good care she does not, and you will see
        her inventing a thousand excuses.

      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS The crows too will prove your divinity to them by pecking
        out the eyes of their flocks and of their draught-oxen; and then let
        Apollo cure them, since he is a physician and is paid for the
        purpose.(1)

        bullocks.

        PISTHETAERUS If on the other hand they recognize that you are God, the
        principle of life, that you are Earth, Saturn, Posidon, they shall be
        loaded with benefits.
      </p>

        EUELPIDES Ah! ah! these are far better kings for us than Zeus!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Far better, are they not? And firstly, we shall not have to
        build them temples of hewn stone, closed with gates of gold; they will
        dwell amongst the bushes and in the thickets of green oak; the most
        venerated of birds will have no other temple than the foliage of the
        olive tree; we shall not go to Delphi or to Ammon to sacrifice;(1) but
        standing erect in the midst of arbutus and wild olives and holding forth
        our hands filled with wheat and barley, we shall pray them to admit us
        to a share of the blessings they enjoy and shall at once obtain them for
        a few grains of wheat.

      <p>
        Weak mortals, chained to the earth, creatures of clay as frail as the
        foliage of the woods, you unfortunate race, whose life is but darkness,
        as unreal as a shadow, the illusion of a dream, hearken to us, who are
        immortal beings, ethereal, ever young and occupied with eternal
        thoughts, for we shall teach you about all celestial matters; you shall
        know thoroughly what is the nature of the birds, what the origin of the
        gods, of the rivers, of Erebus, and Chaos; thanks to us, even
        Prodicus(3) will envy you your knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the beginning there was only Chaos, Night, dark Erebus, and deep
        Tartarus. Earth, the air and heaven had no existence. Firstly,
        black-winged Night laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite
        deeps of Erebus, and from this, after the revolution of long ages,
        sprang the graceful Eros with his glittering golden wings, swift as the
        whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep Tartarus with dark Chaos,
        winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race, which was the
        first to see the light. That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros
        had brought together all the ingredients of the world, and from their
        marriage Heaven, Ocean, Earth and the imperishable race of blessed gods
        sprang into being. Thus our origin is very much older than that of the
        dwellers in Olympus. We are the offspring of Eros; there are a thousand
        proofs to show it. We have wings and we lend assistance to lovers. How
        many handsome youths, who had sworn to remain insensible, have not been
        vanquished by our power and have yielded themselves to their lovers when
        almost at the end of their youth, being led away by the gift of a quail,
        a waterfowl, a goose, or a cock.(4)
      </p>
      <p>
        And what important services do not the birds render to mortals! First of
        all, they mark the seasons for them, springtime, winter, and autumn.
        Does the screaming crane migrate to Libya,&mdash;it warns the husbandman
        to sow, the pilot to take his ease beside his tiller hung up in his
        dwelling,(5) and Orestes(6) to weave a tunic, so that the rigorous cold
        may not drive him any more to strip other folk. When the kite reappears,
        he tells of the return of spring and of the period when the fleece of
        the sheep must be clipped. Is the swallow in sight? All hasten to sell
        their warm tunic and to buy some light clothing. We are your Ammon,
        Delphi, Dodona, your Phoebus Apollo.(7) Before undertaking anything,
        whether a business transaction, a marriage, or the purchase of food, you
        consult the birds by reading the omens, and you give this name of
        omen(8) to all signs that tell of the future. With you a word is an
        omen, you call a sneeze an omen, a meeting an omen, an unknown sound an
        omen, a slave or an ass an omen.(9) Is it not clear that we are a
        prophetic Apollo to you? If you recognize us as gods, we shall be your
        divining Muses, through us you will know the winds and the seasons,
        summer, winter, and the temperate months. We shall not withdraw
        ourselves to the highest clouds like Zeus, but shall be among you and
        shall give to you and to your children and the children of your
        children, health and wealth, long life, peace, youth, laughter, songs
        and feasts; in short, you will all be so well off, that you will be
        weary and satiated with enjoyment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, rustic Muse of such varied note, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx, I sing with
        you in the groves and on the mountain tops, tio, tio, tio, tio,
        tiotinx.(10) I poured forth sacred strains from my golden throat in
        honour of the god Pan,(11) tio, tio, tio, tiotinx, from the top of the
        thickly leaved ash, and my voice mingles with the mighty choirs who
        extol Cybele on the mountain tops,(12) tototototototototinx. 'Tis to our
        concerts that Phrynichus comes to pillage like a bee the ambrosia of his
        songs, the sweetness of which so charms the ear, tio, tio, tio, tio,
        tinx.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there be one of you spectators who wishes to spend the rest of his
        life quietly among the birds, let him come to us. All that is
        disgraceful and forbidden by law on earth is on the contrary honourable
        among us, the birds. For instance, among you 'tis a crime to beat your
        father, but with us 'tis an estimable deed; it's considered fine to run
        straight at your father and hit him, saying, "Come, lift your spur if
        you want to fight."(13) The runaway slave, whom you brand, is only a
        spotted francolin with us.(14) Are you Phrygian like Spintharus?(15)
        Among us you would be the Phrygian bird, the goldfinch, of the race of
        Philemon.(16) Are you a slave and a Carian like Execestides? Among us
        you can create yourself fore-fathers;(17) you can always find relations.
        Does the son of Pisias want to betray the gates of the city to the foe?
        Let him become a partridge, the fitting offspring of his father; among
        us there is no shame in escaping as cleverly as a partridge.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the swans on the banks of the Hebrus, tio, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx,
        mingle their voices to serenade Apollo, tio, tio, tio, tio. tiotinx,
        flapping their wings the while, tio, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx; their notes
        reach beyond the clouds of heaven; all the dwellers in the forest stand
        still with astonishment and delight; a calm rests upon the waters, and
        the Graces and the choirs in Olympus catch up the strain, tio, tio, tio,
        tio, tiotinx.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is nothing more useful nor more pleasant than to have wings. To
        begin with, just let us suppose a spectator to be dying with hunger and
        to be weary of the choruses of the tragic poets; if he were winged, he
        would fly off, go home to dine and come back with his stomach filled.
        Some Patroclides in urgent need would not have to soil his cloak, but
        could fly off, satisfy his requirements, and, having recovered his
        breath, return. If one of you, it matters not who, had adulterous
        relations and saw the husband of his mistress in the seats of the
        senators, he might stretch his wings, fly thither, and, having appeased
        his craving, resume his place. Is it not the most priceless gift of all,
        to be winged? Look at Diitrephes!(18) His wings were only wicker-work
        ones, and yet he got himself chosen Phylarch and then Hipparch; from
        being nobody, he has risen to be famous; 'tis now the finest gilded cock
        of his tribe.(19)

        name implies, were the leaders of the cavalry; there were only two of
        these in the Athenian army.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(19) He had become a senator.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Halloa! What's this? By Zeus! I never saw anything so funny
        in all my life.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Pisthetaerus and Euelpides now both return with wings.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES What makes you laugh?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis your bits of wings. D'you know what you look like?
        Like a goose painted by some dauber-fellow.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES And you look like a close-shaven blackbird.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis ourselves asked for this transformation, and, as
        Aeschylus has it, "These are no borrowed feathers, but truly our
        own."(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Meaning, 'tis we who wanted to have these wings.&mdash;The verse
        from Aeschylus, quoted here, is taken from 'The Myrmidons,' a tragedy of
        which only a few fragments remain.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Come now, what must be done?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS First give our city a great and famous name, then sacrifice
        to the gods.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES I think so too.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Let's see. What shall our city be called?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Will you have a high-sounding Laconian name? Shall we call
        it Sparta?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES What! call my town Sparta? Why, I would not use esparto for my
        bed,(1) even though I had nothing but bands of rushes.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The Greek word signified the city of Sparta, and also a kind of
        broom used for weaving rough matting, which served for the beds of the
        very poor.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Well then, what name can you suggest?
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Some name borrowed from the clouds, from these lofty regions
        in which we dwell&mdash;in short, some well-known name.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Do you like Nephelococcygia?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A fanciful name constructed from (the word for) a cloud, and (the
        word for) a cuckoo; thus a city of clouds and cuckoos.&mdash;'Wolkenkukelheim'
        is a clever approximation in German. Cloud-cuckoo-town, perhaps, is the
        best English equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Oh! capital! truly 'tis a brilliant thought!
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Is it in Nephelococcygia that all the wealth of Theovenes(1)
        and most of Aeschines'(2) is?
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) He was a boaster nicknamed 'smoke,' because he promised a great
        deal and never kept his word.

      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS No, 'tis rather the plain of Phlegra,(1) where the gods
        withered the pride of the sons of the Earth with their shafts.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Because the war of the Titans against the gods was only a fiction
        of the poets.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Oh! what a splendid city! But what god shall be its patron?
        for whom shall we weave the peplus?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A sacred cloth, with which the statue of Athene in the Acropolis
        was draped.
      </p>

        PISTHETAERUS Why not choose Athene Polias?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Meaning, to be patron-goddess of the city. Athene had a temple of
        this name.
      </p>
      <p>

        armed from head to foot, while Clisthenes(1) was spinning!
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) An Athenian effeminate, frequently ridiculed by Aristophanes.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Who then shall guard the Pelargicon?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) This was the name of the wall surrounding the Acropolis.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS One of us, a bird of Persian strain, who is everywhere proclaimed
        to be the bravest of all, a true chick of Ares.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) i.e. the fighting cock.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES Oh! noble chick! What a well-chosen god for a rocky home!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Come! into the air with you to help the workers who are
        building the wall; carry up rubble, strip yourself to mix the mortar,
        take up the hod, tumble down the ladder, an you like, post sentinels,
        keep the fire smouldering beneath the ashes, go round the walls, bell in
        hand,(1) and go to sleep up there yourself; then d(i)spatch two heralds,
        one to the gods above, the other to mankind on earth and come back here.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) To waken the sentinels, who might else have fallen asleep.&mdash;There
        are several merry contradictions in the various parts of this list of
        injunctions.
      </p>
      <p>
        EUELPIDES As for yourself, remain here, and may the plague take you for
        a troublesome fellow!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Go, friend, go where I send you, for without you my orders
        cannot be obeyed. For myself, I want to sacrifice to the new god, and I
        am going to summon the priest who must preside at the ceremony. Slaves!
        slaves! bring forward the basket and the lustral water.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS I do as you do, and I wish as you wish, and I implore you to
        address powerful and solemn prayers to the gods, and in addition to
        immolate a sheep as a token of our gratitude. Let us sing the Pythian
        chant in honour of the god, and let Chaeris accompany our voices.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS (TO THE FLUTE-PLAYER) Enough! but, by Heracles! what is
        this? Great gods! I have seen many prodigious things, but I never saw a
        muzzled raven.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) In allusion to the leather strap which flute-players wore to
        constrict the cheeks and add to the power of the breath. The performer
        here no doubt wore a raven's mask.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPOPS Priest! 'tis high time! Sacrifice to the new gods.
      </p>
      <p>
        PRIEST I begin, but where is he with the basket? Pray to the Vesta of
        the birds, to the kite, who presides over the hearth, and to all the god
        and goddess-birds who dwell in Olympus.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Oh! Hawk, the sacred guardian of Sunium, oh, god of the storks!
      </p>
      <p>
        PRIEST Pray to the swan of Delos, to Latona the mother of the quails,
        and to Artemis, the goldfinch.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis no longer Artemis Colaenis, but Artemis the
        goldfinch.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Hellanicus, the Mitylenian historian, tells that this surname of
        Artemis is derived from Colaenus, King of Athens before Cecrops and a
        descendant of Hermes. In obedience to an oracle he erected a temple to
        the goddess, invoking her as Artemis Colaenis (the Artemis of Colaenus).
      </p>
      <p>
        PRIEST And to Bacchus, the finch and Cybele, the ostrich and mother of
        the gods and mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Oh! sovereign ostrich, Cybele, The mother of Cleocritus,(1) grant
        health and safety to the Nephelococcygians as well as to the dwellers in
        Chios...
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) This Cleocritus, says the scholiast, was long-necked and strutted
        like an ostrich.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS The dwellers in Chios! Ah! I am delighted they should be
        thus mentioned on all occasions.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The Chians were the most faithful allies of Athens, and hence their
        name was always mentioned in prayers, decrees, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS ...to the heroes, the birds, to the sons of heroes, to the
        porphyrion, the pelican, the spoon-bill, the redbreast, the grouse, the
        peacock, the horned-owl, the teal, the bittern, the heron, the stormy
        petrel, the fig-pecker, the titmouse...
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Stop! stop! you drive me crazy with your endless list. Why,
        wretch, to what sacred feast are you inviting the vultures and the
        sea-eagles? Don't you see that a single kite could easily carry off the
        lot at once? Begone, you and your fillets and all; I shall know how to
        complete the sacrifice by myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        PRIEST It is imperative that I sing another sacred chant for the rite of
        the lustral water, and that I invoke the immortals, or at least one of
        them, provided always that you have some suitable food to offer him;
        from what I see here, in the shape of gifts, there is naught whatever
        but horn and hair.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Let us address our sacrifices and our prayers to the winged
        gods.
      </p>
      <p>
        A POET Oh, Muse! celebrate happy Nephelococcygia in your hymns.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What have we here? Where did you come from, tell me? Who
        are you?
      </p>
      <p>
        POET I am he whose language is sweeter than honey, the zealous slave of
        the Muses, as Homer has it.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS You a slave! and yet you wear your hair long?
      </p>
      <p>
        POET No, but the fact is all we poets are the assiduous slaves of the
        Muses, according to Homer.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS In truth your little cloak is quite holy too through zeal!
        But, poet, what ill wind drove you here?
      </p>
      <p>
        POET I have composed verses in honour of your Nephelococcygia, a host of
        splendid dithyrambs and parthenians(1) worthy of Simonides himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Verses sung by maidens.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS And when did you compose them? How long since?
      </p>
      <p>
        POET Oh! 'tis long, aye, very long, that I have sung in honour of this
        city.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS But I am only celebrating its foundation with this
        sacrifice;(1) I have only just named it, as is done with little babies.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) This ceremony took place on the tenth day after birth, and may be
        styled the pagan baptism.
      </p>
      <p>
        POET "Just as the chargers fly with the speed of the wind, so does the
        voice of the Muses take its flight. Oh! thou noble founder of the town
        of Aetna,(1) thou, whose name recalls the holy sacrifices,(2) make us
        such gift as thy generous heart shall suggest."
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Hiero, tyrant of Syracuse.&mdash;This passage is borrowed from
        Pindar.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) (Hiero) in Greek means 'sacrifice.'
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS He will drive us silly if we do not get rid of him by some
        present. Here! you, who have a fur as well as your tunic, take it off
        and give it to this clever poet. Come, take this fur; you look to me to
        be shivering with cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        POET My Muse will gladly accept this gift; but engrave these verses of
        Pindar's on your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Oh! what a pest! 'Tis impossible then to be rid of him!
      </p>
      <p>
        POET "Straton wanders among the Scythian nomads, but has no linen
        garment. He is sad at only wearing an animal's pelt and no tunic." Do
        you conceive my bent?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS I understand that you want me to offer you a tunic. Hi! you
        (TO EUELPIDES), take off yours; we must help the poet.... Come, you,
        take it and begone.
      </p>
      <p>
        POET I am going, and these are the verses that I address to this city:
        "Phoebus of the golden throne, celebrate this shivery, freezing city; I
        have travelled through fruitful and snow-covered plains. Tralala!
        Tralala!"(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A parody of poetic pathos, not to say bathos.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What are you chanting us about frosts? Thanks to the tunic,
        you no longer fear them. Ah! by Zeus! I could not have believed this
        cursed fellow could so soon have learnt the way to our city. Come,
        priest, take the lustral water and circle the altar.
      </p>
      <p>
        PRIEST Let all keep silence!
      </p>
      <p>
        A PROPHET Let not the goat be sacrificed.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Which the priest was preparing to sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Who are you?
      </p>
      <p>
        PROPHET Who am I? A prophet.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Get you gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROPHET Wretched man, insult not sacred things. For there is an oracle
        of Bacis, which exactly applies to Nephelococcygia.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Why did you not reveal it to me before I founded my city?
      </p>
      <p>
        PROPHET The divine spirit was against it.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Well, 'tis best to know the terms of the oracle.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROPHET "But when the wolves and the white crows shall dwell together
        between Corinth and Sicyon..."
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS But how do the Corinthians concern me?
      </p>
      <p>
        PROPHET 'Tis the regions of the air that Bacis indicated in this manner.
        "They must first sacrifice a white-fleeced goat to Pandora, and give the
        prophet, who first reveals my words, a good cloak and new sandals."
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Are the sandals there?
      </p>
      <p>
        PROPHET Read. "And besides this a goblet of wine and a good share of the
        entrails of the victim."
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Of the entrails&mdash;is it so written?
      </p>
      <p>
        PROPHET Read. "If you do as I command, divine youth, you shall be an
        eagle among the clouds; if not, you shall be neither turtle-dove, nor
        eagle, nor woodpecker."
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Is all that there?
      </p>
      <p>
        PROPHET Read.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS This oracle in no sort of way resembles the one Apollo
        dictated to me: "If an impostor comes without invitation to annoy you
        during the sacrifice and to demand a share of the victim, apply a stout
        stick to his ribs."
      </p>
      <p>
        PROPHET You are drivelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS "And don't spare him, were he an eagle from out of the
        clouds, were it Lampon(1) himself or the great Diopithes."(2)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Noted Athenian diviner, who, when the power was still shared
        between Thucydides and Pericles, predicted that it would soon be centred
        in the hands of the latter; his ground for this prophecy was the sight
        of a ram with a single horn.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) No doubt another Athenian diviner, and possibly the same person
        whom Aristophanes names in 'The Knights' and 'The Wasps' as being a
        thief.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROPHET Is all that there?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Here, read it yourself, and go and hang yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROPHET Oh! unfortunate wretch that I am.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Away with you, and take your prophecies elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        METON(1) I have come to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A celebrated geometrician and astronomer.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Yet another pest! What have you come to do? What's your
        plan? What's the purpose of your journey? Why these splendid buskins?
      </p>
      <p>
        METON I want to survey the plains of the air for you and to parcel them
        into lots.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS In the name of the gods, who are you?
      </p>
      <p>
        METON Who am I? Meton, known throughout Greece and at Colonus.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A deme contiguous to Athens. It is as though he said, "Well known
        throughout all England and at Croydon.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What are these things?
      </p>
      <p>
        METON Tools for measuring the air. In truth, the spaces in the air have
        precisely the form of a furnace. With this bent ruler I draw a line from
        top to bottom; from one of its points I describe a circle with the
        compass. Do you understand?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Not the very least.
      </p>
      <p>
        METON With the straight ruler I set to work to inscribe a square within
        this circle; in its centre will be the market-place, into which all the
        straight streets will lead, converging to this centre like a star,
        which, although only orbicular, sends forth its rays in a straight line
        from all sides.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Meton, you new Thales...(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Thales was no less famous as a geometrician than he was as a sage.
      </p>
      <p>
        METON What d'you want with me?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS I want to give you a proof of my friendship. Use your legs.
      </p>
      <p>
        METON Why, what have I to fear?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis the same here as in Sparta. Strangers are driven away,
        and blows rain down as thick as hail.
      </p>
      <p>
        METON Is there sedition in your city?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS No, certainly not.
      </p>
      <p>
        METON What's wrong then?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS We are agreed to sweep all quacks and impostors far from
        our borders.
      </p>
      <p>
        METON Then I'm off.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS I fear 'tis too late. The thunder growls already. (BEATS
        HIM.)
      </p>
      <p>
        METON Oh, woe! oh, woe!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS I warned you. Now, be off, and do your surveying somewhere
        else. (METON TAKES TO HIS HEELS.)
      </p>
      <p>
        AN INSPECTOR Where are the Proxeni?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Officers of Athens, whose duty was to protect strangers who came on
        political or other business, and see to their interests generally.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Who is this Sardanapalus?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) He addresses the inspector thus because of the royal and
        magnificent manners he assumes.
      </p>
      <p>
        INSPECTOR I have been appointed by lot to come to Nephelococcygia as
        inspector.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Magistrates appointed to inspect the tributary towns.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS An inspector! and who sends you here, you rascal?
      </p>
      <p>
        INSPECTOR A decree of T(e)leas.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A much-despised citizen, already mentioned. He ironically supposes
        him invested with the powers of an Archon, which ordinarily were
        entrusted only to men of good repute.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Will you just pocket your salary, do nothing, and be off?
      </p>
      <p>
        INSPECTOR I' faith! that I will; I am urgently needed to be at Athens to
        attend the assembly; for I am charged with the interests of
        Pharnaces.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A Persian satrap.&mdash;An allusion to certain orators, who, bribed
        with Asiatic gold, had often defended the interests of the foe in the
        Public Assembly.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Take it then, and be off. See, here is your salary. (BEATS
        HIM.)
      </p>
      <p>
        INSPECTOR What does this mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis the assembly where you have to defend Pharnaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        INSPECTOR You shall testify that they dare to strike me, the inspector.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Are you not going to clear out with your urns? 'Tis not to
        be believed; they send us inspectors before we have so much as paid
        sacrifice to the gods.
      </p>
      <p>
        A DEALER IN DECREES "If the Nephelococcygian does wrong to the
        Athenian..."
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Now whatever are these cursed parchments?
      </p>
      <p>
        DEALER IN DECREES I am a dealer in decrees, and I have come here to sell
        you the new laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Which?
      </p>
      <p>
        DEALER IN DECREES "The Nephelococcygians shall adopt the same weights,
        measures and decrees as the Olophyxians."(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A Macedonian people in the peninsula of Chalcidice. This name is
        chosen because of its similarity to the Greek word (for) 'to groan.' It
        is from another verb, meaning the same thing, that Pisthetaerus coins
        the name of Ototyxians, i.e. groaners, because he is about to beat the
        dealer.&mdash;The mother-country had the right to impose any law it
        chose upon its colonies.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS And you shall soon be imitating the Ototyxians. (BEATS
        HIM.)
      </p>
      <p>
        DEALER IN DECREES Hullo! what are you doing?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Now will you be off with your decrees? For I am going to
        let YOU see some severe ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        INSPECTOR (RETURNING) I summon Pisthetaerus for outrage for the month of
        Munychion.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Corresponding to our month of April.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ha! my friend! are you still there?
      </p>
      <p>
        DEALER IN DECREES "Should anyone drive away the magistrates and not
        receive them, according to the decree duly posted..."
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What! rascal! you are there too?
      </p>
      <p>
        INSPECTOR Woe to you! I'll have you condemned to a fine of ten thousand
        drachmae.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS And I'll smash your urns.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Which the inspector had brought with him for the purpose of
        inaugurating the assemblies of the people or some tribunal.
      </p>
      <p>
        INSPECTOR Do you recall that evening when you stooled against the column
        where the decrees are posted?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Here! here! let him be seized. (THE INSPECTOR RUNS OFF.)
        Well! don't you want to stop any longer?
      </p>
      <p>
        PRIEST Let us get indoors as quick as possible; we will sacrifice the
        goat inside.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) So that the sacrifices might no longer be interrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Henceforth it is to me that mortals must address their sacrifices
        and their prayers. Nothing escapes my sight nor my might. My glance
        embraces the universe, I preserve the fruit in the flower by destroying
        the thousand kinds of voracious insects the soil produces, which attack
        the trees and feed on the germ when it has scarcely formed in the calyx;
        I destroy those who ravage the balmy terrace gardens like a deadly
        plague; all these gnawing crawling creatures perish beneath the lash of
        my wing. I hear it proclaimed everywhere: "A talent for him who shall
        kill Diagoras of Melos,(1) and a talent for him who destroys one of the
        dead tyrants."(2) We likewise wish to make our proclamation: "A talent
        to him among you who shall kill Philocrates, the Struthian;(3) four, if
        he brings him to us alive. For this Philocrates skewers the finches
        together and sells them at the rate of an obolus for seven. He tortures
        the thrushes by blowing them out, so that they may look bigger, sticks
        their own feathers into the nostrils of blackbirds, and collects
        pigeons, which he shuts up and forces them, fastened in a net, to decoy
        others." That is what we wish to proclaim. And if anyone is keeping
        birds shut up in his yard, let him hasten to let them loose; those who
        disobey shall be seized by the birds and we shall put them in chains, so
        that in their turn they may decoy other men.
      </p>
      <p>
        Happy indeed is the race of winged birds who need no cloak in winter!
        Neither do I fear the relentless rays of the fiery dog-days; when the
        divine grasshopper, intoxicated with the sunlight, when noon is burning
        the ground, is breaking out into shrill melody; my home is beneath the
        foliage in the flowery meadows. I winter in deep caverns, where I frolic
        with the mountain nymphs, while in spring I despoil the gardens of the
        Graces and gather the white, virgin berry on the myrtle bushes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want now to speak to the judges about the prize they are going to
        award; if they are favourable to us, we will load them with benefits far
        greater than those Paris(4) received. Firstly, the owls of Laurium,(5)
        which every judge desires above all things, shall never be wanting to
        you; you shall see them homing with you, building their nests in your
        money-bags and laying coins. Besides, you shall be housed like the gods,
        for we shall erect gables(6) over your dwellings; if you hold some
        public post and want to do a little pilfering, we will give you the
        sharp claws of a hawk. Are you dining in town, we will provide you with
        crops.(7) But, if your award is against us, don't fail to have metal
        covers fashioned for yourselves, like those they place over statues;(8)
        else, look out! for the day you wear a white tunic all the birds will
        soil it with their droppings.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A disciple of Democrites; he passed over from superstition to
        atheism. The injustice and perversity of mankind led him to deny the
        existence of the gods, to lay bare the mysteries and to break the idols.
        The Athenians had put a price on his head, so he left Greece and
        perished soon afterwards in a storm at sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) By this jest Aristophanes means to imply that tyranny is dead, and
        that no one aspires to despotic power, though this silly accusation was
        constantly being raised by the demagogues and always favourably received
        by the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(3) A poulterer.&mdash;Strouthian, used in joke to designate him, as if
        from the name of his 'deme,' is derived from (the Greek for) 'a
        sparrow.' The birds' foe is thus grotesquely furnished with an
        ornithological surname.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(4) From Aphrodite (Venus), to whom he had awarded the apple, prize of
        beauty, in the contest of the "goddesses three."
      </p>
      <p>
        f(5) Laurium was an Athenian deme at the extremity of the Attic
        peninsula containing valuable silver mines, the revenues of which were
        largely employed in the maintenance of the fleet and payment of the
        crews. The "owls of Laurium," of course, mean pieces of money; the
        Athenian coinage was stamped with a representation of an owl, the bird
        of Athene.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(6) A pun, impossible to keep in English, on the two meanings of (the
        Greek) word which signifies both an eagle and the gable of a house or
        pediment of a temple.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(7) That is, birds' crops, into which they could stow away plenty of
        good things.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(8) The Ancients appear to have placed metal discs over statues
        standing in the open air, to save them from injury from the weather,
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Birds! the sacrifice is propitious. But I see no messenger
        coming from the wall to tell us what is happening. Ah! here comes one
        running himself out of breath as though he were running the Olympic
        stadium.
      </p>
      <p>
        MESSENGER Where, where is he? Where, where, where is he? Where, where,
        where is he? Where is Pisthetaerus, our leader?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Here am I.
      </p>
      <p>
        MESSENGER The wall is finished.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS That's good news.
      </p>
      <p>
        MESSENGER 'Tis a most beautiful, a most magnificent work of art. The
        wall is so broad that Proxenides, the Braggartian, and Theogenes could
        pass each other in their chariots, even if they were drawn by steeds as
        big as the Trojan horse.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis wonderful!
      </p>
      <p>
        MESSENGER Its length is one hundred stadia; I measured it myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS A decent length, by Posidon! And who built such a wall?
      </p>
      <p>
        MESSENGER Birds&mdash;birds only; they had neither Egyptian brickmaker,
        nor stone-mason, nor carpenter; the birds did it all themselves; I could
        hardly believe my eyes. Thirty thousand cranes came from Libya with a
        supply of stones,(1) intended for the foundations. The water-rails
        chiselled them with their beaks. Ten thousand storks were busy making
        bricks; plovers and other water fowl carried water into the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) So as not to be carried away by the wind when crossing the sea,
        cranes are popularly supposed to ballast themselves with stones, which
        they carry in their beaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS And who carried the mortar?
      </p>
      <p>
        MESSENGER Herons, in hods.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS But how could they put the mortar into hods?
      </p>
      <p>
        MESSENGER Oh! 'twas a truly clever invention; the geese used their feet
        like spades; they buried them in the pile of mortar and then emptied
        them into the hods.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ah! to what use cannot feet be put?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Pisthetaerus modifies the Greek proverbial saying, "To what use
        cannot hands be put?"
      </p>
      <p>
        MESSENGER You should have seen how eagerly the ducks carried bricks. To
        complete the tale, the swallows came flying to the work, their beaks
        full of mortar and their trowel on their back, just the way little
        children are carried.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Who would want paid servants after this? But tell me, who
        did the woodwork?
      </p>
      <p>
        MESSENGER Birds again, and clever carpenters too, the pelicans, for they
        squared up the gates with their beaks in such a fashion that one would
        have thought they were using axes; the noise was just like a dockyard.
        Now the whole wall is tight everywhere, securely bolted and well
        guarded; it is patrolled, bell in hand; the sentinels stand everywhere
        and beacons burn on the towers. But I must run off to clean myself; the
        rest is your business.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Well! what do you say to it? Are you not astonished at the wall
        being completed so quickly?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS By the gods, yes, and with good reason. 'Tis really not to
        be believed. But here comes another messenger from the wall to bring us
        some further news! What a fighting look he has!
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND MESSENGER Oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What's the matter?
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND MESSENGER A horrible outrage has occurred; a god sent by Zeus has
        passed through our gates and has penetrated the realms of the air
        without the knowledge of the jays, who are on guard in the daytime.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis an unworthy and criminal deed. What god was it?
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND MESSENGER We don't know that. All we know is, that he has got
        wings.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Why were not guards sent against him at once?
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND MESSENGER We have d(i)spatched thirty thousand hawks of the
        legion of Mounted Archers.(1) All the hook-clawed birds are moving
        against him, the kestrel, the buzzard, the vulture, the great-horned
        owl; they cleave the air, so that it resounds with the flapping of their
        wings; they are looking everywhere for the god, who cannot be far away;
        indeed, if I mistake not, he is coming from yonder side.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A corps of Athenian cavalry was so named.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS All arm themselves with slings and bows! This way, all our
        soldiers; shoot and strike! Some one give me a sling!
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS War, a terrible war is breaking out between us and the gods!
        Come, let each one guard Air, the son of Erebus,(1) in which the clouds
        float. Take care no immortal enters it without your knowledge. Scan all
        sides with your glance. Hark! methinks I can hear the rustle of the
        swift wings of a god from heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Chaos, Night, Tartarus, and Erebus alone existed in the beginning;
        Eros was born from Night and Erebus, and he wedded Chaos and begot
        Earth, Air, and Heaven; so runs the fable.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Hi! you woman! where are you flying to? Halt, don't stir!
        keep motionless! not a beat of your wing!&mdash;Who are you and from
        what country? You must say whence you come.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Iris appears from the top of the stage and arrests her flight in
        mid-career.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS I come from the abode of the Olympian gods.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What's your name, ship or cap?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Ship, because of her wings, which resemble oars; cap, because she
        no doubt wore the head-dress (as a messenger of the gods) with which
        Hermes is generally depicted.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS I am swift Iris.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Paralus or Salaminia?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The names of the two sacred galleys which carried Athenian
        officials on State business.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS What do you mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Let a buzzard rush at her and seize her.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A buzzard is named in order to raise a laugh, the Greek name also
        meaning, etymologically, provided with three testicles, vigorous in
        love.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS Seize me! But what do all these insults mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Woe to you!
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS 'Tis incomprehensible.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS By which gate did you pass through the wall, wretched
        woman?
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS By which gate? Why, great gods, I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS You hear how she holds us in derision. Did you present
        yourself to the officers in command of the jays? You don't answer. Have
        you a permit, bearing the seal of the storks?
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS Am I awake?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Did you get one?
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS Are you mad?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS No head-bird gave you a safe-conduct?
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS A safe-conduct to me, you poor fool!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ah! and so you slipped into this city on the sly and into
        these realms of air-land that don't belong to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS And what other roads can the gods travel?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS By Zeus! I know nothing about that, not I. But they won't
        pass this way. And you still dare to complain! Why, if you were treated
        according to your deserts, no Iris would ever have more justly suffered
        death.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS I am immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS You would have died nevertheless.&mdash;Oh! 'twould be
        truly intolerable! What! should the universe obey us and the gods alone
        continue their insolence and not understand that they must submit to the
        law of the strongest in their due turn? But tell me, where are you
        flying to?
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS I? The messenger of Zeus to mankind, I am going to tell them to
        sacrifice sheep and oxen on the altars and to fill their streets with
        the rich smoke of burning fat.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Of which gods are you speaking?
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS Of which? Why, of ourselves, the gods of heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS You, gods?
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS Are there others then?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Men now adore the birds as gods, and 'tis to them, by Zeus,
        that they must offer sacrifices, and not to Zeus at all!
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS Oh! fool! fool! Rouse not the wrath of the gods, for 'tis terrible
        indeed. Armed with the brand of Zeus, Justice would annihilate your
        race; the lightning would strike you as it did Licymnius and consume
        both your body and the porticos of your palace.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Iris' reply is a parody of the tragic style.&mdash;'Lycimnius' is,
        according to the scholiast, the title of a tragedy by Euripides, which
        is about a ship that is struck by lightning.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Here! that's enough tall talk. Just you listen and keep
        quiet! Do you take me for a Lydian or a Phrygian(1) and think to
        frighten me with your big words? Know, that if Zeus worries me again, I
        shall go at the head of my eagles, who are armed with lightning, and
        reduce his dwelling and that of Amphion to cinders.(2) I shall send more
        than six hundred porphyrions clothed in leopards' skins(3) up to heaven
        against him; and formerly a single Porphyrion gave him enough to do. As
        for you, his messenger, if you annoy me, I shall begin by stretching
        your legs asunder, and so conduct myself, Iris though you be, that
        despite my age, you will be astonished. I will show you something that
        will make you three times over.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) i.e. for a poltroon, like the slaves, most of whom came to Athens
        from these countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) A parody of a passage in the lost tragedy of 'Niobe' of Aeschylus.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(3) Because this bird has a spotted plumage.&mdash;Porphyrion is also
        the name of one of the Titans who tried to storm heave.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS May you perish, you wretch, you and your infamous words!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Won't you be off quickly? Come, stretch your wings or look
        out for squalls!
      </p>
      <p>
        IRIS If my father does not punish you for your insults...
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ha!... but just you be off elsewhere to roast younger folk
        than us with your lightning.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS We forbid the gods, the sons of Zeus, to pass through our city
        and the mortals to send them the smoke of their sacrifices by this road.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis odd that the messenger we sent to the mortals has
        never returned.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERALD Oh! blessed Pisthetaerus, very wise, very illustrious, very
        gracious, thrice happy, very... Come, prompt me, somebody, do.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Get to your story!
      </p>
      <p>
        HERALD All peoples are filled with admiration for your wisdom, and they
        award you this golden crown.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS I accept it. But tell me, why do the people admire me?
      </p>
      <p>
        HERALD Oh you, who have founded so illustrious a city in the air, you
        know not in what esteem men hold you and how many there are who burn
        with desire to dwell in it. Before your city was built, all men had a
        mania for Sparta; long hair and fasting were held in honour, men went
        dirty like Socrates and carried staves. Now all is changed. Firstly, as
        soon as 'tis dawn, they all spring out of bed together to go and seek
        their food, the same as you do; then they fly off towards the notices
        and finally devour the decrees. The bird-madness is so clear, that many
        actually bear the names of birds. There is a halting victualler, who
        styles himself the partridge; Menippus calls himself the swallow;
        Opuntius the one-eyed crow; Philocles the lark; Theogenes the fox-goose;
        Lycurgus the ibis; Chaerephon the bat; Syracosius the magpie; Midias the
        quail;(1) indeed he looks like a quail that has been hit hard over the
        head. Out of love for the birds they repeat all the songs which concern
        the swallow, the teal, the goose or the pigeon; in each verse you see
        wings, or at all events a few feathers. This is what is happening down
        there. Finally, there are more than ten thousand folk who are coming
        here from earth to ask you for feathers and hooked claws; so, mind you
        supply yourself with wings for the immigrants.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) All these surnames bore some relation to the character or the build
        of the individual to whom the poet applies them.&mdash;Chaerephon,
        Socrates' disciple, was of white and ashen hue.&mdash;Opuntius was
        one-eyed.&mdash;Syracosius was a braggart.&mdash;Midias had a passion
        for quail-fights, and, besides, resembled that bird physically.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ah! by Zeus, 'tis not the time for idling. Go as quick as
        possible and fill every hamper, every basket you can find with wings.
        Manes(1) will bring them to me outside the walls, where I will welcome
        those who present themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Pisthetaerus' servant, already mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS This town will soon be inhabited by a crowd of men.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS If fortune favours us.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Folk are more and more delighted with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Come, hurry up and bring them along.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Will not man find here everything that can please him&mdash;wisdom,
        love, the divine Graces, the sweet face of gentle peace?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Oh! you lazy servant! won't you hurry yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Let a basket of wings be brought speedily. Come, beat him as I
        do, and put some life into him; he is as lazy as an ass.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Aye, Manes is a great craven.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Begin by putting this heap of wings in order; divide them in
        three parts according to the birds from whom they came; the singing, the
        prophetic(1) and the aquatic birds; then you must take care to
        distribute them to the men according to their character.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) From the inspection of which auguries were taken, e.g. the eagles,
        the vultures, the crows.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS (TO MANES) Oh! by the kestrels! I can keep my hands off you
        no longer; you are too slow and lazy altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        A PARRICIDE(1) Oh! might I but become an eagle, who soars in the skies!
        Oh! might I fly above the azure waves of the barren sea!(2)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Or rather, a young man who contemplated parricide.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) A parody of verses in Sophocles 'Oenomaus.'
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ha! 'twould seem the news was true; I hear someone coming
        who talks of wings.
      </p>
      <p>
        PARRICIDE Nothing is more charming than to fly; I burn with desire to
        live under the same laws as the birds; I am bird-mad and fly towards
        you, for I want to live with you and to obey your laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Which laws? The birds have many laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        PARRICIDE All of them; but the one that pleases me most is, that among
        the birds it is considered a fine thing to peck and strangle one's
        father.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Aye, by Zeus! according to us, he who dares to strike his
        father, while still a chick, is a brave fellow.
      </p>
      <p>
        PARRICIDE And therefore I want to dwell here, for I want to strangle my
        father and inherit his wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS But we have also an ancient law written in the code of the
        storks, which runs thus, "When the stork father has reared his young and
        has taught them to fly, the young must in their turn support the
        father."
      </p>
      <p>
        PARRICIDE 'Tis hardly worth while coming all this distance to be
        compelled to keep my father!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS No, no, young friend, since you have come to us with such
        willingness, I am going to give you these black wings, as though you
        were an orphan bird; furthermore, some good advice, that I received
        myself in infancy. Don't strike your father, but take these wings in one
        hand and these spurs in the other; imagine you have a cock's crest on
        your head and go and mount guard and fight; live on your pay and respect
        your father's life. You're a gallant fellow! Very well, then! Fly to
        Thrace and fight.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The Athenians were then besieging Amphipolis in the Thracian
        Chalcidice.

        PARRICIDE By Bacchus! 'Tis well spoken; I will follow your counsel.

        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis acting wisely, by Zeus.

        CINESIAS(1) "On my light pinions I soar off to Olympus; in its
        capricious flight my Muse flutters along the thousand paths of poetry in
        turn..."
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) There was a real Cinesias&mdash;a dythyrambic poet born at Thebes.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS This is a fellow will need a whole shipload of wings.
      </p>
      <p>
        CINESIAS (singing) "...and being fearless and vigorous, it is seeking
        fresh outlet."
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Welcome, Cinesias, you lime-wood man!(1) Why have you come
        here a-twisting your game leg in circles?
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The scholiast thinks that Cinesias, who was tall and slight of
        build, wore a kind of corset of lime-wood to support his waist&mdash;surely
        rather a far-fetched interpretation!
      </p>
      <p>
        CINESIAS "I want to become a bird, a tuneful nightingale."
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Enough of that sort of ditty. Tell me what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        CINESIAS Give me wings and I will fly into the topmost airs to gather
        fresh songs in the clouds, in the midst of the vapours and the fleecy
        snow.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Gather songs in the clouds?
      </p>
      <p>
        CINESIAS 'Tis on them the whole of our latter-day art depends. The most
        brilliant dithyrambs are those that flap their wings in void space and
        are clothed in mist and dense obscurity. To appreciate this, just
        listen.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Oh! no, no, no!
      </p>
      <p>
        CINESIAS By Hermes! but indeed you shall. "I shall travel through thine
        ethereal empire like a winged bird, who cleaveth space with his long
        neck..."

        winds..."

        PISTHETAERUS By Zeus! but I'll cut your breath short.
      </p>
      <p>
        CINESIAS "...now rushing along the tracks of Notus, now nearing Boreas
        across the infinite wastes of the ether." (PISTHETAERUS BEATS HIM.) Ah!
        old man, that's a pretty and clever idea truly!

        PISTHETAERUS What! are you not delighted to be cleaving the air?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Cinesias makes a bound each time that Pisthetaerus strikes him.
      </p>
      <p>
        CINESIAS To treat a dithyrambic poet, for whom the tribes dispute with
        each other, in this style!(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The tribes of Athens, or rather the rich citizens belonging to
        them, were wont on feast-days to give representations of dithyrambic
        choruses as well as of tragedies and comedies.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Will you stay with us and form a chorus of winged birds as
        slender as Leotrophides(1) for the Cecropid tribe?
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Another dithyrambic poet, a man of extreme leanness.
      </p>
      <p>
        CINESIAS You are making game of me, 'tis clear; but know that I shall
        never leave you in peace if I do not have wings wherewith to traverse
        the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        AN INFORMER What are these birds with downy feathers, who look so
        pitiable to me? Tell me, oh swallow with the long dappled wings.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A parody of a hemistich from 'Alcaeus.'&mdash;The informer is
        dissatisfied at only seeing birds of sombre plumage and poor appearance.
        He would have preferred to denounce the rich.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Oh! but 'tis a regular invasion that threatens us. Here
        comes another of them, humming along.
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER Swallow with the long dappled wings, once more I summon you.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS It's his cloak I believe he's addressing; 'faith, it stands
        in great need of the swallows' return.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The informer, says the scholiast, was clothed with a ragged cloak,
        the tatters of which hung down like wings, in fact, a cloak that could
        not protect him from the cold and must have made him long for the
        swallows' return, i.e. the spring.
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER Where is he who gives out wings to all comers?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis I, but you must tell me for what purpose you want
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER Ask no questions. I want wings, and wings I must have.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Do you want to fly straight to Pellene?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A town in Achaia, where woollen cloaks were made.
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER I? Why, I am an accuser of the islands,(1) an informer...
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) His trade was to accuse the rich citizens of the subject islands,
        and drag them before the Athenian court; he explains later the special
        advantages of this branch of the informer's business.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS A fine trade, truly!
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER ...a hatcher of lawsuits. Hence I have great need of wings to
        prowl round the cities and drag them before justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Would you do this better if you had wings?
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER No, but I should no longer fear the pirates; I should return
        with the cranes, loaded with a supply of lawsuits by way of ballast.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS So it seems, despite all your youthful vigour, you make it
        your trade to denounce strangers?
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER Well, and why not? I don't know how to dig.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS But, by Zeus! there are honest ways of gaining a living at
        your age without all this infamous trickery.
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER My friend, I am asking you for wings, not for words.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis just my words that give you wings.
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER And how can you give a man wings with your words?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS 'Tis thus that all first start.
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER All?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Have you not often heard the father say to young men in the
        barbers' shops, "It's astonishing how Diitrephes' advice has made my son
        fly to horse-riding."&mdash;"Mine," says another, "has flown towards
        tragic poetry on the wings of his imagination."
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER So that words give wings?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Undoubtedly; words give wings to the mind and make a man
        soar to heaven. Thus I hope that my wise words will give you wings to
        fly to some less degrading trade.
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER But I do not want to.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What do you reckon on doing then?
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER I won't belie my breeding; from generation to generation we
        have lived by informing. Quick, therefore, give me quickly some light,
        swift hawk or kestrel wings, so that I may summon the islanders, sustain
        the accusation here, and haste back there again on flying pinions.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS I see. In this way the stranger will be condemned even
        before he appears.
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER That's just it.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS And while he is on his way here by sea, you will be flying
        to the islands to despoil him of his property.
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER You've hit it, precisely; I must whirl hither and thither like
        a perfect humming-top.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS I catch the idea. Wait, i' faith, I've got some fine
        Corcyraean wings.(1) How do you like them?
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) That is, whips&mdash;Corcyra being famous for these articles.
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER Oh! woe is me! Why, 'tis a whip!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS No, no; these are the wings, I tell you, that set the top
        a-spinning.
      </p>
      <p>
        INFORMER Oh! oh! oh!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Take your flight, clear off, you miserable cur, or you will
        soon see what comes of quibbling and lying. Come, let us gather up our
        wings and withdraw.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS In my ethereal flights I have seen many things new and strange
        and wondrous beyond belief. There is a tree called Cleonymus belonging
        to an unknown species; it has no heart, is good for nothing and is as
        tall as it is cowardly. In springtime it shoots forth calumnies instead
        of buds and in autumn it strews the ground with bucklers in place of
        leaves.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        Far away in the regions of darkness, where no ray of light ever enters,
        there is a country, where men sit at the table of the heroes and dwell
        with them always&mdash;save always in the evening. Should any mortal
        meet the hero Orestes at night, he would soon be stripped and covered
        with blows from head to foot.(2)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Cleonymous is a standing butt of Aristophanes' wit, both as an
        informer and a notorious poltroon.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) In allusion to the cave of the bandit Orestes; the poet terms him a
        hero only because of his heroic name Orestes.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS Ah! by the gods! if only Zeus does not espy me! Where is
        Pisthetaerus?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ha! what is this? A masked man!
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS Can you see any god behind me?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS No, none. But who are you, pray?
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS What's the time, please?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS The time? Why, it's past noon. Who are you?
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS Is it the fall of day? Is it no later than that?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Prometheus wants night to come and so reduce the risk of being seen
        from Olympus.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Oh! 'pon my word! but you grow tiresome.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS What is Zeus doing? Is he dispersing the clouds or gathering
        them?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The clouds would prevent Zeus seeing what was happening below him.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Take care, lest I lose all patience.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS Come, I will raise my mask.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ah! my dear Prometheus!
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS Stop! stop! speak lower!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Why, what's the matter, Prometheus?
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS H'sh! h'sh! Don't call me by my name; you will be my ruin, if
        Zeus should see me here. But, if you want me to tell you how things are
        going in heaven, take this umbrella and shield me, so that the gods
        don't see me.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS I can recognize Prometheus in this cunning trick. Come,
        quick then, and fear nothing; speak on.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS Then listen.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS I am listening, proceed!
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS It's all over with Zeus.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ah! and since when, pray?
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS Since you founded this city in the air. There is not a man
        who now sacrifices to the gods; the smoke of the victims no longer
        reaches us. Not the smallest offering comes! We fast as though it were
        the festival of Demeter.(1) The barbarian gods, who are dying of hunger,
        are bawling like Illyrians(2) and threaten to make an armed descent upon
        Zeus, if he does not open markets where joints of the victims are sold.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The third day of the festival of Demeter was a fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) A semi-savage people, addicted to violence and brigandage.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What! there are other gods besides you, barbarian gods who
        dwell above Olympus?
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS If there were no barbarian gods, who would be the patron of
        Execestides?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Who, being reputed a stranger despite his pretension to the title
        of a citizen, could only have a strange god for his patron or tutelary
        deity.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS And what is the name of these gods?
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS Their name? Why, the Triballi.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The Triballi were a Thracian people; it was a term commonly used in
        Athens to describe coarse men, obscene debauchees and greedy parasites.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ah, indeed! 'tis from that no doubt that we derive the word
        'tribulation.'(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) There is a similar pun in the Greek.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS Most likely. But one thing I can tell you for certain,
        namely, that Zeus and the celestial Triballi are going to send deputies
        here to sue for peace. Now don't you treat, unless Zeus restores the
        sceptre to the birds and gives you Basileia(1) in marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) i.e. the 'supremacy' of Greece, the real object of the war.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Who is this Basileia?
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS A very fine young damsel, who makes the lightning for Zeus;
        all things come from her, wisdom, good laws, virtue, the fleet,
        calumnies, the public paymaster and the triobolus.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ah! then she is a sort of general manageress to the god.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS Yes, precisely. If he gives you her for your wife, yours will
        be the almighty power. That is what I have come to tell you; for you
        know my constant and habitual goodwill towards men.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Oh, yes! 'tis thanks to you that we roast our meat.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Prometheus had stolen the fire from the gods to gratify mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS I hate the gods, as you know.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Aye, by Zeus, you have always detested them.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROMETHEUS Towards them I am a veritable Timon;(1) but I must return in
        all haste, so give me the umbrella; if Zeus should see me from up there,
        he would think I was escorting one of the Canephori.(2)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) A celebrated misanthrope, contemporary to Aristophanes. Hating the
        society of men, he had only a single friend, Apimantus, to whom he was
        attached, because of their similarity of character; he also liked
        Alcibiades, because he foresaw that this young man would be the ruin of
        his country.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) The Canephori were young maidens, chosen from the first families of
        the city, who carried baskets wreathed with myrtle at the feast of
        Athene, while at those of Bacchus and Demeter they appeared with gilded
        baskets.&mdash;The daughters of 'Metics,' or resident aliens, walked
        behind them, carrying an umbrella and a stool.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Wait, take this stool as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Near by the land of the Sciapodes(1) there is a marsh, from the
        borders whereof the odious Socrates evokes the souls of men. Pisander(2)
        came one day to see his soul, which he had left there when still alive.
        He offered a little victim, a camel,(3) slit his throat and, following
        the example of Ulysses, stepped one pace backwards.(4) Then that bat of
        a Chaerephon(5) came up from hell to drink the camel's blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) According to Ctesias, the Sciapodes were a people who dwelt on the
        borders of the Atlantic. Their feet were larger than the rest of their
        bodies, and to shield themselves from the sun's rays they held up one of
        their feet as an umbrella.&mdash;By giving the Socratic philosophers the
        name of Sciapodes here Aristophanes wishes to convey that they are
        walking in the dark and busying themselves with the greatest nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) This Pisander was a notorious coward; for this reason the poet
        jestingly supposes that he had lost his soul, the seat of courage.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(3) Considering the shape and height of the camel, (it) can certainly
        not be included in the list of SMALL victims, e.g. the sheep and the
        goat.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(4) In the evocation of the dead, Book XI of the Odyssey.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(5) Chaerephon was given this same title by the Herald earlier in this
        comedy.&mdash;Aristophanes supposes him to have come from hell because
        he is lean and pallid.
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON(1) This is the city of Nephelococcygia, Cloud-cuckoo-town,
        whither we come as ambassadors. (TO TRIBALLUS) Hi! what are you up to?
        you are throwing your cloak over the left shoulder. Come, fling it quick
        over the right! And why, pray, does it draggle in this fashion? Have you
        ulcers to hide like Laespodias?(2) Oh! democracy!(3) whither, oh!
        whither are you leading us? Is it possible that the gods have chosen
        such an envoy?
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Posidon appears on the stage accompanied by Heracles and a
        Triballian god.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) An Athenian general.&mdash;Neptune is trying to give Triballus some
        notions of elegance and good behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(3) Aristophanes supposes that democracy is in the ascendant in Olympus
        as it is in Athens.
      </p>
      <p>
        TRIBALLUS Leave me alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON Ugh! the cursed savage! you are by far the most barbarous of all
        the gods.&mdash;Tell me, Heracles, what are we going to do?
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES I have already told you that I want to strangle the fellow who
        has dared to block us in.
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON But, my friend, we are envoys of peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES All the more reason why I wish to strangle him.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Hand me the cheese-grater; bring me the silphium for sauce;
        pass me the cheese and watch the coals.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) He is addressing his servant, Manes.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES Mortal! we who greet you are three gods.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Wait a bit till I have prepared my silphium pickle.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES What are these meats?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Heracles softens at sight of the food.&mdash;Heracles is the
        glutton of the comic poets.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS These are birds that have been punished with death for
        attacking the people's friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES And you are seasoning them before answering us?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ah! Heracles! welcome, welcome! What's the matter?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) He pretends not to have seen them at first, being so much engaged
        with his cookery.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES The gods have sent us here as ambassadors to treat for peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        A SERVANT There's no more oil in the flask.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS And yet the birds must be thoroughly basted with it.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) He pretends to forget the presence of the ambassadors.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES We have no interest to serve in fighting you; as for you, be
        friends and we promise that you shall always have rain-water in your
        pools and the warmest of warm weather. So far as these points go we are
        armed with plenary authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS We have never been the aggressors, and even now we are as
        well disposed for peace as yourselves, provided you agree to one
        equitable condition, namely, that Zeus yield his sceptre to the birds.
        If only this is agreed to, I invite the ambassadors to dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES That's good enough for me. I vote for peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON You wretch! you are nothing but a fool and a glutton. Do you
        want to dethrone your own father?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What an error! Why, the gods will be much more powerful if
        the birds govern the earth. At present the mortals are hidden beneath
        the clouds, escape your observation, and commit perjury in your name;
        but if you had the birds for your allies, and a man, after having sworn
        by the crow and Zeus, should fail to keep his oath, the crow would dive
        down upon him unawares and pluck out his eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON Well thought of, by Posidon!(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Posidon jestingly swears by himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES My notion too.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS (TO THE TRIBALLIAN) And you, what's your opinion?
      </p>
      <p>
        TRIBALLUS Nabaisatreu.(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The barbarian god utters some gibberish which Pisthetaerus
        interprets into consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS D'you see? he also approves. But hear another thing in
        which we can serve you. If a man vows to offer a sacrifice to some god,
        and then procrastinates, pretending that the gods can wait, and thus
        does not keep his word, we shall punish his stinginess.
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON Ah! ah! and how?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS While he is counting his money or is in the bath, a kite
        will relieve him, before he knows it, either in coin or in clothes, of
        the value of a couple of sheep, and carry it to the god.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES I vote for restoring them the sceptre.
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON Ask the Triballian.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES Hi Triballian, do you want a thrashing?
      </p>
      <p>
        TRIBALLUS Saunaka baktarikrousa.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES He says, "Right willingly."
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON If that be the opinion of both of you, why, I consent too.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES Very well! we accord the sceptre.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Ah! I was nearly forgetting another condition. I will leave
        Here to Zeus, but only if the young Basileia is given me in marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON Then you don't want peace. Let us withdraw.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS It matters mighty little to me. Cook, look to the gravy.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES What an odd fellow this Posidon is! Where are you off to? Are
        we going to war about a woman?
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON What else is there to do?
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES What else? Why, conclude peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON Oh! you ninny! do you always want to be fooled? Why, you are
        seeking your own downfall. If Zeus were to die, after having yielded
        them the sovereignty, you would be ruined, for you are the heir of all
        the wealth he will leave behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Oh! by the gods! how he is cajoling you. Step aside, that I
        may have a word with you. Your uncle is getting the better of you, my
        poor friend.(1) The law will not allow you an obolus of the paternal
        property, for you are a bastard and not a legitimate child.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Heracles, the god of strength, was far from being remarkable in the
        way of cleverness.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES I a bastard! What's that you tell me?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Why, certainly; are you not born of a stranger woman?
        Besides, is not Athene recognized as Zeus' sole heiress? And no daughter
        would be that, if she had a legitimate brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES But what if my father wished to give me his property on his
        death-bed, even though I be a bastard?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS The law forbids it, and this same Posidon would be the
        first to lay claim to his wealth, in virtue of being his legitimate
        brother. Listen; thus runs Solon's law: "A bastard shall not inherit, if
        there are legitimate children; and if there are no legitimate children,
        the property shall pass to the nearest kin."(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) This was Athenian law.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES And I get nothing whatever of the paternal property?
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Absolutely nothing. But tell me, has your father had you
        entered on the registers of his phratria?(1)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The poet attributes to the gods the same customs as those which
        governed Athens, and according to which no child was looked upon as
        legitimate unless his father had entered him on the registers of his
        phratria. The phratria was a division of the tribe and consisted of
        thirty families.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES No, and I have long been surprised at the omission.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS What ails you, that you should shake your fist at heaven?
        Do you want to fight it? Why, be on my side, I will make you a king and
        will feed you on bird's milk and honey.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES Your further condition seems fair to me. I cede you the young
        damsel.
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON But I, I vote against this opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Then it all depends on the Triballian. (TO THE TRIBALLIAN.)
        What do you say?
      </p>
      <p>
        TRIBALLUS Big bird give daughter pretty and queen.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES You say that you give her?
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON Why no, he does not say anything of the sort, that he gives her;
        else I cannot understand any better than the swallows.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Exactly so. Does he not say she must be given to the
        swallows?
      </p>
      <p>
        POSIDON Very well! you two arrange the matter; make peace, since you
        wish it so; I'll hold my tongue.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES We are of a mind to grant you all that you ask. But come up
        there with us to receive Basileia and the celestial bounty.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Here are birds already cut up, and very suitable for a
        nuptial feast.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES You go and, if you like, I will stay here to roast them.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS You to roast them! you are too much the glutton; come along
        with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        HERACLES Ah! how well I would have treated myself!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Let some(one) bring me a beautiful and magnificent tunic
        for the wedding.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS(1) At Phanae,(2) near the Clepsydra,(3) there dwells a people who
        have neither faith nor law, the Englottogastors,(4) who reap, sow, pluck
        the vines and the figs(5) with their tongues; they belong to a barbaric
        race, and among them the Philippi and the Gorgiases(6) are to be found;
        'tis these Englottogastorian Philippi who introduced the custom all over
        Attica of cutting out the tongue separately at sacrifices.(7)
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) The chorus continues to tell what it has seen on its flights.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(2) The harbour of the island of Chios; but this name is here used in
        the sense of being the land of informers ((from the Greek for) 'to
        denounce').
      </p>
      <p>
        f(3) i.e. near the orators' platform, in the Public Assembly, or because
        there stood the water-clock, by which speeches were limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(4) A coined name, made up of (the Greek for) the tongue, and (for) the
        stomach, and meaning those who fill their stomach with what they gain
        with their tongues, to wit, the orators.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(5) (The Greek for) a fig forms part of the word which in Greek means
        an informer.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(6) Both rhetoricians.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(7) Because they consecrated it specially to the god of eloquence.
      </p>
      <p>
        A MESSENGER Oh, you, whose unbounded happiness I cannot express in
        words, thrice happy race of airy birds, receive your king in your
        fortunate dwellings. More brilliant than the brightest star that illumes
        the earth, he is approaching his glittering golden palace; the sun
        itself does not shine with more dazzling glory. He is entering with his
        bride at his side,(1) whose beauty no human tongue can express; in his
        hand he brandishes the lightning, the winged shaft of Zeus; perfumes of
        unspeakable sweetness pervade the ethereal realms. 'Tis a glorious
        spectacle to see the clouds of incense wafting in light whirlwinds
        before the breath of the Zephyr! But here he is himself. Divine Muse!
        let thy sacred lips begin with songs of happy omen.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Basileia, whom he brings back from heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Fall back! to the right! to the left! advance!(1) Fly around this
        happy mortal, whom Fortune loads with her blessings. Oh! oh! what grace!
        what beauty! Oh, marriage so auspicious for our city! All honour to this
        man! 'tis through him that the birds are called to such glorious
        destinies. Let your nuptial hymns, your nuptial songs, greet him and his
        Basileia! 'Twas in the midst of such festivities that the Fates formerly
        united Olympian Here to the King who governs the gods from the summit of
        his inaccessible throne. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus! Rosy Eros with the
        golden wings held the reins and guided the chariot; 'twas he, who
        presided over the union of Zeus and the fortunate Here. Oh! Hymen! oh!
        Hymenaeus!
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Terms used in regulating a dance.
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS I am delighted with your songs, I applaud your verses. Now
        celebrate the thunder that shakes the earth, the flaming lightning of
        Zeus and the terrible flashing thunderbolt.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHORUS Oh, thou golden flash of the lightning! oh, ye divine shafts of
        flame, that Zeus has hitherto shot forth! Oh, ye rolling thunders, that
        bring down the rain! 'Tis by the order of OUR king that ye shall now
        stagger the earth! Oh, Hymen! 'tis through thee that he commands the
        universe and that he makes Basileia, whom he has robbed from Zeus, take
        her seat at his side. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!
      </p>
      <p>
        PISTHETAERUS Let all the winged tribes of our fellow-citizens follow the
        bridal couple to the palace of Zeus(1) and to the nuptial couch! Stretch
        forth your hands, my dear wife! Take hold of me by my wings and let us
        dance; I am going to lift you up and carry you through the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        f(1) Where Pisthetaerus is henceforth to reign.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
